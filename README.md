# Penne Pinching

- Reactjs
- Ant Design
- Firebase Auth
- GraphQL built on Hasura and Postgres

In mid-January 2020, my girlfriend and I participated in a promotion at Fratelli Fresh, where, for just $399 each we would get one free meal a day for the rest of our lives.

Obviously we grabbed this deal! To settle a bet with a friend about this being a waste of money, I created Penne Pinching.

The page lets us log our meals, update the menu, and view analytics about our history and projections. We can see our trends and overall financial position after the purchase.

It is built using React, Hooks, Apollo GraphQL, XState, Ant Design and Firebase Auth.

The backend is a Harsura container linked to a Postgres DB, which is serving a GraphQL interface.
